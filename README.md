Top Pot Donut Shop

This is a HTML page that generates a list of Top Pot Donut Shops and their average min and max customers and donuts sold per customer to
generate information on total sales over a day using javascript constructors and methods. Later this page will allow users to input their own 
new Top Pot locations and customer information.
